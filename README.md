# Unus

#### An open source card game that totally isn't just Uno why would it be Uno that's just dumb.

## Okay, so how do you play Unus

- Every player gets 7 cards to begin
- The first card off the top of the deck gets put in the middle. This will be the first card to match. 
- A random player is chosen to be first.
- The player will look at their cards, find a card that matches the one in the middle by either color or number/type
- The can place that card down, then their turn ends unless it's one of the special cards
- If the player has no cards that match, they must draw cards until they find one they can play. 
- If the deck runs out of cards for drawing, the center pile is reshuffled except for the top most card
- When a player plays a card that leaves them with only one card in their deck, they must declare Unus, or if a player calls them out for not saying Unus they have to draw 3 cards
- The first person to get rid of all their cards wins. 

Wait but that's ju-

#### Shut up.
